Sweeper Bot

Built for the Windows 7 Minesweeper (if you don't have it, look it up).
Works best on beginner, but can work on intermediate/expert (though performance sucks atm).
Due to dynamic algorithm, it can work on custom grids as well.

If the bot gets stuck on processing something, click on a mine (you might have to fight the bot a bit) or alt-tab and close the window (easier to click a mine though).
If the bot says it failed to guess or the board isn't completed, you can just start the bot again and it should either make more progress, complete the board, or fail all together.
