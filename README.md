Sweeper Bot

Built for the Windows 7 Minesweeper (if you don't have it, look it up).
Works best on beginner, but can work on intermediate/expert (though performance sucks atm).
Due to dynamic algorithm, it can work on custom grids as well.

If the bot gets stuck on processing something, click on a mine (you might have to fight the bot a bit) or alt-tab and close the window (easier to click a mine though).
